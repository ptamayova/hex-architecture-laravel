All backend features MUST follow the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) pattern defined in @docs/ai-rules/backend.md. This enforces strict layer separation: Domain (pure business logic with NO framework dependencies), Application (use cases that return DTOs, never domain entities), and Infrastructure (framework implementations of domain interfaces). Business logic lives in bounded contexts under /src, uses dependency inversion via port interfaces, and maintains clean dependency flow: Infrastructure → Application → Domain. Never violate these boundaries.

<frontend-development>
All frontend features MUST follow the patterns defined in @docs/ai-rules/frontend.md. This enforces: single-action Laravel controllers with __invoke methods (never resource controllers), Inertia.js for server-client communication (never axios/fetch), shadcn/ui components as the ONLY UI library (check before creating custom components), TypeScript interfaces for all props, and separation of concerns (business logic in page components, presentation in dumb components). Always use Inertia's router for navigation and type all data flowing from Laravel to React.

<clean-code-principles>
All code across every layer MUST follow the clean code principles defined in @docs/ai-rules/clean-code.md. This enforces: meaningful, intention-revealing names; small functions with single responsibility (< 20 lines ideal); DRY principle by extracting duplicated logic into reusable abstractions; simplicity over cleverness (code junior developers can understand); and strategic comments that explain WHY, not WHAT. The code itself should be self-documenting. These principles apply to Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Controllers, React components, and all other code.
